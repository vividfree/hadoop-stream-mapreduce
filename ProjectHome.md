This project provides a C++ MapReduce programming interface
built upon Hadoop Streaming.  It was motivated by the following
reasons:

> _The need for "secondary key" and related API_

> Secondary key is not supported by Hadoop.  It allows mappers
> optionally output a <key, secondary\_key, value> triple other
> than the traditional <key, value> pair.  On the shuffling
> stage, one or more <secondary\_key, value> pairs are
> aggregated into a reduce input if these pairs have the same
> key.  In addition, values in a reduce input are sorted by
> their corresponding secondary\_keys.

> _The support for native C++ programming_

> Hadoop supports C++ in two ways: (1) Hadoop Pipes, which
> provides a C++ API (without secondary key), and (2) Hadoop
> Streamining, which languages executable files generated by
> any programming language in map/reduce worker processes.
> However, in Hadoop 0.20.1, some Java code implementing Pipes
> is marked deprecated. So I build this project basing on
> Streaming.
